While this mode should work for any SuSy based course, it has only
being tested on MC102, hence the name.

This mode simplifies the tedious work of grading code for TAs at any
university using SuSy, which, AFAIK, is only UNICAMP. Once configured,
this mode enables, with single keystrokes, viewing a student's code,
its SuSy generated results page, compiling and testing the code
locally against the reference homework zip, and grade it based on
pre-defined criteria. Also, it can generate an html report with the
code.
